# GUI_hw_1

Creating a simple webpage for my Dog Lincoln! I used what learned about containers in the tutorials to create a simple plage going over GSP dogs. I did get some HTTPS errors when inserting the validation check code but before entering those in my code was running without any errors. Overall I am very satisfied wiht my first simple site.
