          <h2>Appearance</h2>
          <p>
            GSPs are medium to large-sized dogs, with a muscular, athletic
            build. They have short, dense coats that come in a variety of colors
            including liver, black, and white. Their coats are easy to maintain,
            and require only occasional brushing. They have a distinctive head
            shape with long, floppy ears and a strong jaw.

          <h2>Temperment</h2>
          <p>
            GSPs are highly energetic and require a lot of exercise. They are
            intelligent and eager to please, making them easy to train. They are
            known for their loyalty and affection towards their owners, and can
            be excellent family dogs. However, they can be reserved around
            strangers, and may require socialization training to be comfortable
            around unfamiliar people and dogs.

        <div class="Health">
          <h2>Health</h2>
          <p>
            GSPs are generally healthy dogs, with a life expectancy of 10-12
            years. However, like all breeds, they are prone to certain health
            conditions. Some of the most common health issues that affect GSPs
            include hip dysplasia, bloat, and epilepsy. Regular veterinary
            checkups, a healthy diet, and regular exercise can help prevent and
            manage these conditions.

        <div class="Training">
          <h2>Training</h2>
          <p>
            GSPs are highly trainable, and excel in obedience and agility
            training. They require a lot of mental and physical stimulation to
            prevent boredom, and benefit from activities like running, swimming,
            and hunting. Positive reinforcement training methods are recommended
            for GSPs, as they can be sensitive to harsh punishment.
